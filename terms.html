        <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall Grow Garden Green, its affiliates, directors, employees, agents, suppliers, or licensors be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses (even if Grow Garden Green has been advised of the possibility of such damages), arising out of or in connection with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Site or Services;</li>
            <li>Any conduct or content of any third party on the Site or Services;</li>
            <li>Any content obtained from the Site or Services;</li>

This limitation of liability applies whether the alleged liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other basis.</p>
        <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the limitations above may not apply to you.
